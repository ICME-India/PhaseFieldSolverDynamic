The solver requires {\itshape dynamic\+Interface\+Refine\+Fv\+Mesh} library, and has been successfully tested using Open\+FOAM v6. Before compiling the solver, the library must be obtained in the following procedure\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item You can compile the lib where ever you want. This is just an example\+: \begin{quote}
mkdir -\/p \$\+FOAM\+\_\+\+RUN/../\+Open\+FOAM\+\_\+extensions \end{quote}

\item Switch to this directory \begin{quote}
cd \$\+FOAM\+\_\+\+RUN/../\+Open\+FOAM\+\_\+extensions \end{quote}

\item Clone the repository \begin{quote}
git clone \href{https://bitbucket.org/shor-ty/dynamicinterfacerefinefvmesh.git}{\texttt{ https\+://bitbucket.\+org/shor-\/ty/dynamicinterfacerefinefvmesh.\+git}} \end{quote}

\item Move to the new library folder \begin{quote}
cd dynamicinterfacerefinefvmesh \end{quote}

\item Checkout the openfoam version you need (e.\+g. using 5.\+x) \begin{quote}
git checkout Open\+FOAM-\/5.\+x \end{quote}

\item Go to the library source \begin{quote}
cd src/dynamic\+Fv\+Mesh \end{quote}

\item Compile the lib \begin{quote}
wmake libso \end{quote}

\item Finally you have to include the libary into your solver set-\/up. Therefore add the following line to your dynamic\+Mesh\+Dict \begin{quote}
dynamic\+Fv\+Mesh\+Libs ( \char`\"{}libdynamic\+Interface\+Refine\+Fv\+Mesh.\+so\char`\"{} ); \end{quote}

\item The best way is to copy the dynamic\+Mesh\+Dict to your case and modify it.

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Following commands should create the executable of the solver \begin{quote}
cd \$\+FOAM\+\_\+\+RUN/phase\+Field\+Solver\+Dynamic/phase\+Field\+Solver\+Dynamic \end{quote}
\begin{quote}
wclean \end{quote}
\begin{quote}
wmake \end{quote}

\item The solver can be run by following the instructions in {\itshape user\+Guide}.

The implementation, client and header files of the solver have been written following Open\+FOAM conventions. These are explained next with flow charts generated from the source code using Doxygen. It must be noted that the solver is based on \href{https://www.openfoam.com/documentation/guides/latest/doc/guide-applications-solvers-basic-laplacianFoam.html}{\texttt{ laplacian\+Foam}} solver within Open\+FOAM. Hence, it may be helpful for the user to become familiar with \href{http://foam.sourceforge.net/docs/Guides-a4/ProgrammersGuide.pdf}{\texttt{ Open\+FOAM Programmerâ€™s Guide}} and \href{https://www.openfoam.com/documentation/guides/latest/doc/guide-applications-solvers-basic-laplacianFoam.html}{\texttt{ laplacian\+Foam}} beforehand.
